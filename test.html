        <h2 style="font-family:Georgia;">'The Life and Times of Maciej'</h2>
        <p style="font-size:98%;">
         I was born in 1986 in Gliwice, Poland.
         My family and I moved to Chicago on September 13th, 1987.
         We lived in the Portage Park area for a few years before
         moving out to the suburbs. I was fortunate to get a good education,
         including the (at the time) dreadful Saturday's of Polish school.
         More recently, I moved to Bridgeport after I was accepted into the
         graduate program at IIT.

        <h2 style="font-family:Georgia;"> Music Studies</h2>
        <p style="font-size:98%;">
         I didn't study anything related to computer technology 
         or computer programming until
         about two years before I decided to apply to IIT.
         My undergraduate years were spent studying music composition
         at Columbia College Chicago.
         I was fortunate to have enjoyed a lot of
         unique and rare experiences that I would never have been a part of otherwise.

        <p>
        I spent a lot of time writing music that I thought
        was challenging and pretty interesting. My classmates and I were very grateful
        to have our compositions performed by professional musicians.

        <p style="font-size:98%;">
        My plan for the time I have left at IIT is to do
        everything and anything I can to become a better
        Android Developer.
        I was recently very blessed to have been accepted into IIT's
        new mentorship program. I am being guided down a path towards 
        hard work and a career I can value by an IIT alumnus. I have been
        incredibly blessed to have this opportunity.
        I'm currently working on an app that is meant to help users
        learn and study Chinese verbs. I'm trying to challenge myself
        and make the app stand out by using pictures to show the meaning
        of the verbs instead of using translated English text.

        <p style="font-size:98%;">
        Even before I knew much about programming, I thought that being a firmware developer
        was where it was at in the tech industry. I went to a convention over the summer and
        attended an "Arduino for Newbies" workshop and I was hooked.
        My career plan is to get into the indusrtry as an Android Developer and 
        then start moving towards Embedded Android or any embedded systems engineering
        opportunities that might come my way.
        Until then, I'll be dreaming of wires...
